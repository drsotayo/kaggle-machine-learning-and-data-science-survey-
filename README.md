An **executive summary** of this notebook is [available here](https://www.drsotayo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-Kaggle-Survey-A-focus-on-Nigerian-Kagglers.pdf). 

## Background
This year (2021), Kaggle carried out its 5th Machine Learning & Data Science Survey, which received over 25,000 responses from users globally. It covered data science and machine learning questions for students and professionals across several industries, including their educational backgrounds, salaries, sectors, programming languages and techniques and many more. 

Focusing on the 2021 dataset, this analysis focuses on a unique and specific subset of the dataset, i.e., Nigerian Kagglers, represented in this survey.

Nigeria is a country in West Africa and the most populous country in Africa with over [210,000,000 people](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/nigeria-population/) and boasts of the largest economy in Africa. As such, this analysis aims to answer some questions related to Nigerian Kagglers, which are shown below: 

•	What’s the **uptake of Nigerians on Kaggle** and **how has it changed** over the past few years, and **how will it change** over the next few years? 

•	In a **global and African context**, how are Nigerians performing on Kaggle?

•	What **educational qualifications** do Nigerian Kagglers possess?

•	What are the **age ranges** and **gender distributions** of Nigerian Kagglers?

•	How much do Nigerian Kagglers **earn**? 

•	What **jobs** do Nigerian Kagglers do, and how does the **salary** vary between these jobs?

•	What **sectors** do they work in?

•	What are the most common **programming languages** and **integrated development environments (IDEs)** used by Nigerian kagglers?

•	What are the commonly used **machine learning frameworks** and **machine learning algorithms** used by Nigerian Kagglers? 

•	What **platforms and media sources** do Nigerian Kagglers use to learn more about data science?

## Concluding Remarks

This notebook covers the analysis of a unique and specific subset of the dataset, i.e., Nigerian Kagglers, represented in the 2021 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey. Some interesting questions were posed around Nigerian Kagglers, which were answered with some data exploration, narrative texts and visualisations. 

A summary of the concluding remarks are shown below:

•	In comparison to **64 countries**, **Nigeria Kagglers make up about 2.7%** and is **ranked 7th**.

•	There has been **steady growth** over the past five years, and the total number of responses for the 2021 Kaggle Survey from **Nigeria was 702**. Also, this number for **2021** is about **10 times greater** than in **2017**. A regression model shows that the number will approach and **exceed 1,000 in two-three years**.

•	Within Africa, **Nigeria Kagglers** made up 34% and **ranked number one**. Furthermore, the top three African countries on Kaggle are **Nigeria, Egypt and Kenya**. However, ranking of the African countries **per ten million population** shows that **Nigeria** is **ranked 5th**.


•	The analysis of **gender distribution** shows that 1**5% of Nigerian Kagglers are women and 85% are men**. This reflects a **significant gender gap** among Nigerian Kagglers. 

•	Apart from students, most Nigerian Kagglers are **Data Analysts, Data Scientists and Software Engineers**.

•	The **largest proportion (30%)** of Nigerian Kagglers are in the age range of **25 - 29**. Also, **91%** of Nigerian Kagglers are **younger than 40**. This shows that most Nigerian Kagglers are reasonably young. 

•	The most common education level for Nigerian Kagglers is a **Bachelor's degree (52%)**. About **93% have at least a Bachelor's degree**.

•	Most Nigeria Kagglers work in the **Academics/Education, Computers/Technology and Accounting/Finance sectors**.

•	Almost half of Nigerian Kagglers (45 per cent) **earn less than USD 1,000 per year**. In general, the salary distribution for **Data Analysts, Data Scientists and Software Engineers (Nigerian Kagglers)** are similar and mainly earn **less than USD 3,000 per year**.

•	The **top programming language** for Nigerian Kagglers is **Python**, which is similar to the rest of the world. Most Nigerian Kagglers also use **Python, SQL and Javascript regularly**. 

•	The three most popular IDEs among Nigerian Kagglers and the rest of the world are **Jupyter Notebook, VScode and PyCharm**.

•	**Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Keras** are the most popular Machine Learning frameworks.

•	**Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees/Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines(XGBoost, lightgbm, etc.)** are the most popular Machine Learning algorithms used regularly by Nigerian Kagglers.

•	The most common databases used by Nigerian Kagglers are **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server**. 

•	The top **three** favourite media sources on data science topics by Nigerian Kagglers are **Kaggle, YouTube and Blogs**.
