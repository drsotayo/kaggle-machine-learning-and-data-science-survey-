# kaggle-machine-learning-and-data-science-survey-

Kaggle is an online community of students, data scientists and machine learning practitioners from around the world. Kaggle allows people to undertake courses, learn, find and publish datasets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges. 

This year (2021), Kaggle carried out its 5th Machine Learning & Data Science Survey, which received over 25,000 responses from users globally. It covered data science and machine learning questions for students and professionals across several industries, including their educational backgrounds, salaries, sectors, programming languages and techniques and many more. 

Focusing on the 2021 dataset, this analysis focuses on a unique and specific subset of the dataset, i.e., Nigerian Kagglers, represented in this survey.

Nigeria is a country in West Africa and the most populous country in Africa with over [210,000,000 people](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/nigeria-population/) and boasts of the largest economy in Africa. As such, this analysis aims to answer some questions related to Nigerian Kagglers, which are shown below: 

•	What’s the **uptake of Nigerians on Kaggle** and **how has it changed** over the past few years, and **how will it change** over the next few years? 

•	In a **global and African context**, how are Nigerians performing on Kaggle?

•	What **educational qualifications** do Nigerian Kagglers possess?

•	What are the **age ranges** and **gender distributions** of Nigerian Kagglers?

•	How much do Nigerian Kagglers **earn**? 

•	What **jobs** do Nigerian Kagglers do, and how does the **salary** vary between these jobs?

•	What **sectors** do they work in?

•	What are the most common **programming languages** and **integrated development environments (IDEs)** used by Nigerian kagglers?

•	What are the commonly used **machine learning frameworks** and **machine learning algorithms** used by Nigerian Kagglers? 

•	What **platforms and media sources** do Nigerian Kagglers use to learn more about data science? 

This notebook mainly uses **Pandas** to manipulate the dataset and **Plotly** for the visualisation due to its interactive features.
